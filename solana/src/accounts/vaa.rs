//! VAA type specific to Solana.
//!
//! Solana's VAA kind represents a VAA "after" it has been processed by the bridge, it differs in a
//! two minor ways specific to Solana:
//!
//! - The field order differs from the Wormhole VAA wire format.
//! - Rather than include Signatures directly, it has a Pubkey to a signature account.
//!
//! It forms the basis of both Message and VAA accounts on Solana, but is still trivially
//! convertible back to the core VAA type in the SDK.
